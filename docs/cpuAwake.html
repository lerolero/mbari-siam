<b>NAME</b>
<blockquote>cpuAwake - Keep the CPU awake (veto sleep mode), or
schedule
a wakeup in the future.</blockquote>
<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
<blockquote>
  <pre>cpuAwake [when] [howLong] [-r rqstID] [nodeHost]</pre>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>[when] - seconds in the future to schedule the CPU to wake up.&nbsp; 0 (zero) specifies now.<br>[howLong] - number of seconds you need the CPU awake<br>[-r rqstID] - requestor ID.&nbsp; Defaults to 1, the user ID<br>[nodeHost] - node you want awake.&nbsp; Defaults to "localhost".</pre>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>DEFAULTS</b>
<blockquote>when = 0 (stay awake starting now)
  <br>
howLong = 600 (10 minutes)
  <br>
rqstID = 1 (the user ID)
  <br>
nodeHost = "localhost"</blockquote>
<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<blockquote>The cpuAwake utility establishes a <i>cpu lease</i> to
keep the CPU awake (when
= 0), or to schedule a wakeup in the future.&nbsp; Note that all
parameters
have defaults, so if you just type "cpuAwake", it will keep the CPU
awake
for 10 minutes. If in addition to keeping the cpu awake you also want
to maintain a wireless network connection, use the <a
 style="font-style: italic;" href="lease.html">lease</a> utility
instead.<br>
  <p>If you provide just one number, it assumes you've specified
"howLong",
and the "when" is 0 (now).&nbsp; Thus, "cpuAwake 120" will keep the CPU
awake for 2 minutes.
  </p>
  <p>The [-r rqstID] parameter allows the use of separate wakeup
requests.&nbsp;
Unlike<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><a
 style="font-style: italic;" href="lease.html">lease</a>, which gives
you a new lease every
time you call it, <b>cpuAwake</b> defaults to working on the single
user
request.&nbsp; Any subsequent calls to <b>cpuAwake </b>override the
previous
invocation.&nbsp; However, the [-r rqstID] allows operation on
different
requests.&nbsp; It's used mostly by system shell scripts, to allow them
to issue separate requests from the user.
  <br>
&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<b>EXAMPLES</b>
<blockquote>"cpuAwake" - keep the CPU awake for 10 minutes starting
now.
  <p>"cpuAwake 120" - keep the CPU awake for 2 minutes starting now.
  </p>
  <p>"cpuAwake 60 120" - schedule a wakeup for 1&nbsp; minute from now,
then
keep the CPU awake for 2 minutes.
  </p>
  <p>"cpuAwake 0" - cancel any previous "cpuAwake"s, allowing the CPU
sleep
schedule to resume its normal cycle.</p>
