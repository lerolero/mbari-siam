<b>NAME</b>
<blockquote>Instrument Service Properties</blockquote>
<b>DESCRIPTION</b><blockquote>
Configuration and state of a SIAM instrument service is defined by the 
service's <i>properties</i>. Every instrument service has a set of "generic" 
properties, as listed below. In addition, specific services can define 
additional properties. All service properties and their values can be 
displayed with the <a href="portProperties.html"<i>portProperties</i></a> 
command 

<p>
The following generic properties are "configurable", and their value may be 
specified when the service jarfile is built, or with the 
<a href="setProperty.html"<i>setProperty</i></a> utility
while the service is running (except for for the sampleSchedule property, 
which must be set with the <a href="scheduler.html"<i>setSchedule</i></a> 
utility).
<pre>

isiID               ISI-ID of device
serviceName         Name of service
UUID                Universal unique identifier of device

nominalCurrentMa    Expected nominal instrument current draw
peakCurrentMa       Expected maximum instrument current draw
currentLimitMa      DPA overcurrent trip if this limit exceeded
powerOnDelaySec     Seconds to pause before first power-on
startDelayMsec      Pause (msec) after each power-on
powerPolicy         Set to ALWAYS, NEVER, or SAMPLING
commPowerPolicy     Set to ALWAYS, NEVER, or SAMPLING

timeSynch           If true, try to synchronize instrument clock with 
                    node clock when service starts

sampleSchedule      Sample acquisition schedule
maxSampleTries      Number of times to attempt per scheduled sample acquisition
sampleTimeoutMsec   Timeout (msec) on serial read during acquisition

summaryTriggerCount Generate summary packet after this many raw samples are
                    acquired

maxSummarySamples   Generate summary packet and clear statistics after this many raw samples
                    are acquired

defaultSkipInterval Number of "raw" SensorDataPackets to skip when 
                    telemetering data; set to zero to retrieve all raw
                    packets; set to -1 to retrieve no raw packets
                    (e.g. during summarization)


packetSetSize       Number of SIAM packets to retrieve per "set" by portal

errCacheLimit       Generate MessagePacket after this many successive errors

instrumentName      Unused

</pre>
(Summarization and telemetry subsampling properties are described 
<a href="summariesAndFiltering.html"<i>here</i></a>).
<p>
The following are generic "state properties", which can be displayed but 
cannot be modified by the user:
<pre>
className           Name of service class
parentID=1446       ISI-ID of host platform
extendedVersionK    Unused
frameworkVersion    SIAM version of service base class

serviceStatus=0     Current status of service: 0=OK, 1=ERROR, 2=INITIAL, 
                    3=SHUTDOWN, 4=SUSPEND, 5=SAMPLING, 6=SLEEPING, 7=SAFE
</pre>
<p>
Note that the current configurable property values of a running service can 
be "cached" such that the service will assume these values the next time 
it is started on the current port; see <a href="cachePort.html">cachePort</a>.
