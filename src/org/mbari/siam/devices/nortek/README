Note that the Aquadopp service does NOT comprehensively configure the 
instrument at startup; thus it is very important that a technician properly 
configure the device before running the service, e.g. using the AquaPro GUI. 
These manual configuration steps include:

1. You MUST properly set the instrument baud to 19200. To set the baud through
AquaPro, select Communication->SerialPort and set the baud to 19200. Then you
MUST start a deployment (see below) in order to make the selected baud 
"stick". 

2. To make your configuration choices "stick", you must start and then
stop a recorder deployment with AquaPro before running the SIAM
service. To start a deployment select 
Deployment->StartRecorderDeployment, and answer the prompts appropriately.
After the deployment is started, stop it by selecting 
Deployment->StopRecorderDeployment.
