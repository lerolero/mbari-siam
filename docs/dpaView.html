<b>NAME</b>
<blockquote>dpaView - manipulate DPA ports</blockquote>

<p><br><b>SYNOPSIS</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>DPA test and configuration tool</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><br><b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<blockquote>The dpaView utility is a (bash) script-based utility that provides
a control and status interface to DPA hardware. dpaView exposes several
layers of status and control information, allowing the user to perform
a range of tasks from setting register bits to initializing all installed
DPAs using a few commands. The utility is implemented as a thin shell wrapper,
allowing the user to execute shell commands from within dpaView, and to
place instructions in a text file and use them as input for batch operations.
As a shell script, it may be used in a minimal environment, and is easily
modified without special tools.
<p>dpaView provides built in help for the commands; (type 'help') at the
prompt for assistance.</blockquote>

<p><br><b>ENVIRONMENT</b>

a backplane. The following components must be on the sidearm:
