This directory contains executables that must run as root.
To build them, su to root and then run make.

Failure to build them as root may cause SIAM to hang.

The only utility we need in this directory is foceio.
The others (relay, ioport) are now deprecated.

In particular, relay.c manipulates the power relays
without taking into account the state that FOCE wants
to maintain.  Use this for testing only!
