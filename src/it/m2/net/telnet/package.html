This package contains NVTCom, an implementation of a client for RFC 2217. RFC 2217 is an extension to Telnet (RFC 854) that supports line control, baud rates, etc.  This package was modified slightly from the standard distribution of NVTCom at http://www.viara.eu/en/nvtcom.htm in order to provide support for methods needed by gnu.io.SerialPort
