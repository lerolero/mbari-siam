The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) was founded in 1987 by David Packard.

 The mission of MBARI is to achieve and maintain a position 
as a world center for advanced research and education in 
ocean science and technology, and to do so through the development 
of better instruments, systems, and methods for scientific research
 in the deep waters of the ocean. 

MBARI emphasizes the peer relationship between engineers and scientists 
as a basic principle of its operation. All of the activities of MBARI 
must be characterized by excellence, innovation, and vision.

Science and technology goals
To carry out its mission, the institute has defined six main goals:

 * Identify important areas of marine science where 
   research progress is limited by lack of appropriate technology.

 * Develop sophisticated systems for investigating 
   aspects of the marine environment and its inhabitants 
   where high scientific potential exists.

 * Meet the highest possible performance standards for the
   operation of its equipment and technological systems.

 * Conduct high-quality, innovative research that maximizes 
   effective management and use of all MBARI assets.

 * Develop, in collaboration with the Monterey Bay Aquarium, 
   creative programs that maximize the educational value of 
   MBARIâ€™s research results.

 * Transfer research results, technology, and operational techniques 
   to the marine science community worldwide.
