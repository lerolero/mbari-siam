This folder contains hex files that can be used by the Quadravox development tools to program pucks with puck firmware.  The 'non-isolated ver 0.1.txt' was created by using the Quadravox development tools to extract the memory contents of a puck that had been programmed via the IAR msp430 tools and then saved as 'non-isolated ver 0.1.txt'.
