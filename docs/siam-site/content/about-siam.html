<h1>Getting Started Guide</h1>
<h2>What is SIAM?</h2>
<p>Software Infrastructure and Applications for Monterey Ocean Observing System (SIAM) consists of middleware and applications 
designed to enable automated platform configuration and data collection on sensor networks. 
SIAM has components to do data collection, archiving and telemetry. 
</p>
<p>Originally designed for ocean observing systems, SIAM architecture is made to be scalable and interoperable, allowing it to
 work with a wide range of platforms, instruments and  applications. It's distributed architecture makes it possible to configure 
 and operate SIAM remotely, even on networks with low throughput and intermittent connectivity. 
 It scales well to relatively small processors (ARM), or to more capable hardware, and can support networks with many nodes and instruments.
Since SIAM is also very robust, it is suitable for use in autonomous in-situ systems, or for distributed systems with centralized computing resources.
</p>
<p>SIAM's key features and capabilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instrument service framework makes it easier to integrate new sensors</li>
<li>Accurately timestamped data collection for binary, ascii and image data</li>
<li>Supports PUCK protocol to enable automated platform and data system configuration and interoperability</li>
<li>Supports polled and streaming instruments</li>
<li>Data summarization scheme for low-bandwidth telemetry links</li>
<li>Robust local data storage</li>
<li>Support for wireless/networked data telemetry using satellite, line-of-sight RF or ethernet</li>
<li>Supports Open Source Data Turbine data streaming middleware and clients</li>
<li>SIAM is based on Java and open source software, making it easy to learn, use and adapt</li>
<li>Royalty free license</li>
</ul>

<p>Though SIAM is not designed to be a highly deterministic real-time system, it does support reasonably high sampling rates; typical applications 
to date feature polled sampling rates as frequently as 1 Hz and streaming data capture of several Hertz. SIAM uses NTP to maintain an accurate system clock
used to timestamp data.
 </p>

<h2>What's Included</h2>
<p>
This guide contains documentation that enables designers and operators of observing systems and sensor networks to install and use SIAM in their application.
SIAM does require a bit of effort to bring up - it is flexible and powerful, and its configuration and use are application-driven.
</p>
<p>The basic steps involved in setting up SIAM are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install 3rd party open-source software packages</li>
<li>Build SIAM sources</li>
<li>Configure SIAM</li>
<li>Run SIAM</li>
</ul>
