<b>NAME</b>
<blockquote>Instrument Data Summaries and Telemetry Subsampling</blockquote>
<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<blockquote>SIAM instrument services acquire and log all raw data
specified by their acquisition schedules. To aid management of limited
telemetry bandwidth,
an instrument service can be configured such that only every <i>nth</i>
raw packet is returned in the telemetry stream; this feature is
referred to as <i>telemetry subsampling</i>. The configurable
  <i>defaultSkipInterval</i> <a href="instrumentProperties.html"><i>instrument
service property</i></a> specifies the number of "raw"
SensorDataPackets to skip when telemetering data. A property value of 0
means to return all raw data for that instrument through the telemetry
stream; a value of -1 means that <b>no</b> raw data for the instrument
should be retrieved through the telemetry stream.
  <p>For example, the following invocation of the <a
 href="setProperty.html"><i>setProperty</i></a> utility specifies that
only every
10th raw sample from the instrument on port 3 of the local host should
be retrieved via the shore-side <a href="portal.html"><i>portal</i></a>;
as usual, setProperty should always be
followed by <a href="restartPort.html"><i>restartPort</i></a>:
  </p>
  <pre>% setProperty localhost 3 defaultSkipInterval=10<br>% restartPort localhost 3<br></pre>
Note that defaultSkipInterval is applied only to the telemetry stream;
the
instrument service continues to save <i>all</i> raw samples to its
device log. Telemetry filtering can be manipulated further with
the&nbsp;<a style="font-style: italic;" href="filters.html">getfilter,
clearfilter, and setfilter</a> utilities.<br>
  <p>
In addition, some services can be configured to "summarize" as well as
log their raw data, and to return only these summaries in the telemetry
stream. Summaries are "moving", in the sense that as a new raw data
sample is acquired by a service and added to the data set used in
computing the summary, the oldest sample is dropped from the data set
Note that not all services can generate summaries, and you currently
must have <i>a priori</i> knowledge of which services can summarize.
Moreover each instrument service may implement a different
summarization algorithm; "moving averaging" is common, but other
techniques can be implemented by the service developer.
  </p>
  <p>The following configurable <a href="instrumentProperties.html"><i>service
properties</i></a> specify the frequency of summarization:
  </p>
  <pre>summaryTriggerCount Generate summary packet after this many raw samples are<br>                    acquired; width of the moving summary "window".<br><br>maxSummarySamples   Generate summary packet and initialize contents of the<br>                    moving summary "window" when this many raw samples<br>                    are acquired<br></pre>
Note that in almost all cases, <b>NO</b> raw instrument data should be
retrieved through the service's telemetry stream when summarization is
enabled; thus you <b>must</b> set the service's defaultSkipInterval
property to -1.
  <p>For example, the following invocation of the <a
 href="setProperty.html"><i>setProperty</i></a> utility specifies that
for the
service on port 3 of the local host, summary packets should be
generated for
every 36 samples, and that NO raw data should be retrieved by the
shore-side
portal:
  </p>
  <pre>% setProperty localhost 3 summaryTriggerCount=36 maxSummarySamples=36 defaultSkipInterval=-1<br></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
<b>KNOWN BUGS</b></p>
<blockquote>Setting summarization properties with the <i>setProperty</i>
utility followed by <i>restartPort</i> does NOT currently work as
expected, i.e. the new summarization properties do not take effect. For
the new properties to take effect, you should use <i>setProperty</i>
to set the values as in the above
example, then invoke the <a href="cachePort.html"><i>cachePort</i></a>
utility,
then terminate the service with the <a href="shutdownPort.html"><i>shutdownPort</i></a>
utility, and finally invoke <a href="scanPort.html"><i>scanPort</i></a>
to restart the service.
