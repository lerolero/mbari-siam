		<h3>About SIAM site documention</h3>
		<p>
		This is a site for testing proposed HTML and CSS styles for SIAM software documentation.<br /><br />
		The basic idea is to use a framework for SIAM software documentation that enables
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A good user experience</li>
			<li>Simple content authoring</li>
			<li>Minimal but effective formatting and navigation</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Without spending too much time fussing over formatting.<br />
		It is an initial iteration along the spectrum of simplicity and capability...<br />
		</p>
		
		<p>
		To that end, a few simple style sheets have been developed for navigation, general content, along with formats tailored for man pages and HOWTO docs.<br />
		This page, for example, uses the content style.<br />
		These are combined with a limited number of 3rd-party CSS/javascript navigation widgets that are also easy to use and configure.<br />
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The HTML templates may be found in <a href="../src">SIAM_HOME/docs/siam-site/src</a><br />
		The CSS files may be found in <a href="../css">SIAM_HOME/docs/siam-site/css</a><br />
		Each HTML template contains comments that help to know what to edit.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Let me know what you think...
