Additional build instructions:

Populate the ./include subdirectory with jni.h and jni_md.h from
the host Java distribution.

You may need to edit the macro CC in Makefile.  This Makefile
refers to its location on workstation seamonkey.

After this library (libsystemCall.so) is built, copy it to the target
system. Ensure that it is in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH of
the application or in the IVE home directory if using J9 along with the
rest of the shared libraries.
